# Task-Management-App
A Task Management App using React and Node.js is a classic full-stack web development project

Here's a breakdown of what the project will involve:
Project Overview:

    Backend: Node.js with Express (API handling)
    Database: MongoDB (using Mongoose for interaction)
    Task features:
        Create tasks
        Edit tasks
        Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
        Delete tasks

Steps to Create the Project:
1. Setup the Backend (Node.js with Express):

    Setup a new Node.js project with Express
    Create routes for task management (CRUD operations)
    Setup MongoDB connection with Mongoose
    Create a Task model schema

2. Setup the Frontend (React):

    Create a React app for the frontend
    Build components like TaskList, TaskForm, TaskItem
    Integrate with the backend using Axios or Fetch API

3. Deploying:
